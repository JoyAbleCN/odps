# Window functions

You can use window functions to flexibly analyze and process jobs in MaxCompute SQL.

**Note:**

-   Window functions can only be included in the `SELECT` clause.
-   A window function cannot contain nested window functions or aggregate functions.
-   Window functions cannot be used with aggregate functions of the same level.
-   A maximum of five window functions can be used in a MaxCompute SQL statement.

## Syntax

```
window_func() over (partition by [col1,col2…]
[order by [col1[asc|desc], col2[asc|desc]…]] windowing_clause)
```

-   `PARTITION BY`: partitioning columns.
-   Rows with the same partitioning column value are considered in the same window. A window can contain a maximum of 100 million rows of data. We recommend that the number of rows in a window not exceed 5 million. If the number of rows exceeds 5 million, an error is returned. This limit applies to all built-in window functions.

    **Note:** `GROUP BY` UID indicates that records with the same UID are considered in the same window. Therefore, the records with the same UID can contain a maximum of 100 million rows of data. We recommend that the number of rows in a window not exceed 5 million.

-   `ORDER BY`: the rule used to sort data in a window.

    **Note:** If some values in `ORDER BY` are the same, the sorting result may not be accurate. To reduce randomness, keep each value in `ORDER BY` unique.

-   You can use the following `ROWS` functions in `windowing_clause` to specify the partitioning method:

    -   `rows between x preceding|following and y preceding|following`: indicates a window range from the xth row preceding or following the current row to the yth row preceding or following the current row.
    -   `rows x preceding|following`: indicates a window range from the xth row preceding or following the current row to the current row.
    **Note:**

    -   x and y must be integer constants greater than or equal to 0. Their values range from 0 to 10000. 0 indicates the current row. Before you use `ROWS`, you must specify `ORDER BY` to specify a window range.
    -   Only the following window functions can use `ROWS` to specify the partitioning method: AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, STDDEV, and SUM.

## COUNT

This section describes the syntax, description, and example of the COUNT function.

-   Syntax

    ```
    Bigint count([distinct] expr) over(partition by [col1, col2…]
    [order by [col1[asc|desc], col2[asc|desc]…]] [windowing_clause])
    ```

-   Description

    Calculates the number of rows that meet expr.

-   Parameters

    -   `expr`: a value of any data type. If the value for a row is NULL, the row is not included in the calculation. If the `distinct` keyword is specified, this parameter indicates that only distinct values are counted.
    -   `partition by [col1, col2…]`: partitioning columns.
    -   `order by col1 [asc|desc], col2[asc|desc]`: If `ORDER BY` is not specified, the number of rows that meet `expr` in the current window is returned. If `ORDER BY` is specified, the returned results are sorted in the specified order and the number of rows from the starting row to the current row in the current window is returned.
    **Note:** `ORDER BY` cannot be used if the `distinct` keyword is specified.

-   Return value

    Returns a value of the BIGINT type.

-   Example

    The `test_src` table contains the `user_id` column of the BIGINT type.

    ```
    select user_id,count(user_id) over (partition by user_id) as count
    from test_src;
    +---------+------------+
    | user_id |  count     |
    +---------+------------+
    | 1       | 3          |
    | 1       | 3          |
    | 1       | 3          |
    | 2       | 1          |
    | 3       | 1          |
    +---------+------------+    
    -- If ORDER BY is not specified, the number of rows of the user_id column from the current window is returned.
    select user_id,count(user_id) over (partition by user_id order by user_id) as count
    from test_src;
    +---------+------------+
    | user_id | count      |
    +---------+------------+
    | 1       | 1          |      -- This row is the starting row of this window.
    | 1       | 2          |      -- Two records exist from the starting row to the current row. The number 2 is returned.
    | 1       | 3          |
    | 2       | 1          |
    | 3       | 1          |
    +---------+------------+
    -- If ORDER BY is specified, the number of rows from the starting row to the current row in the current window is returned.
    ```


If duplicate values are specified for `ORDER BY`, the processing method is based on the compatibility between MaxCompute and Hive.

-   If MaxCompute is not compatible with Hive, the returned values are COUNT.

    ```
    set odps.sql.hive.compatible=false;
    select user_id, price, count(price) over
      (partition by user_id order by price) as count from test_src;
    
    +------------+------------+------------+
    | user_id    | price      | count      |
    +------------+------------+------------+
    | 1          | 4.5        | 1          |  -- This row is the starting row of this window.
    | 1          | 5.5        | 2          |  -- The value of COUNT for the second row is 2.
    | 1          | 5.5        | 3          |  -- The value of COUNT for the third row is 3.
    | 1          | 6.5        | 4          |
    | 2          | NULL       | 0          |
    | 2          | 3.0        | 1          |
    | 3          | NULL       | 0          |
    | 3          | 4.0        | 1          |
    +------------+------------+------------+
    ```

-   If MaxCompute is compatible with Hive, the return value is the value of COUNT for the last row of the rows with same values.

    ```
    set odps.sql.hive.compatible=true;
    select user_id, price, count(price) over
      (partition by user_id order by price) as count from test_src;
    
    +------------+------------+------------+
    | user_id    | price      | count      |
    +------------+------------+------------+
    | 1          | 4.5        | 1          | -- This row is the starting row of this window.
    | 1          | 5.5        | 3          | -- The value of COUNT for the second row is the value of COUNT for the third row because the prices of the two rows are the same.
    | 1          | 5.5        | 3          | -- The value of COUNT for the third row is 3.
    | 1          | 6.5        | 4          |
    | 2          | NULL       | 0          |
    | 2          | 3.0        | 1          |
    | 3          | NULL       | 0          |
    | 3          | 4.0        | 1          |
    +------------+------------+------------+
    ```


## AVG

    ```
    lag(expr, Bigint offset, default) over(partition by [col1, col2…]
    [order by [col1[asc|desc], col2[asc|desc]…]])
    ```

-   Description

    Returns the value for a row at a given offset preceding the current row. If the current row number is `rn`, the value of the row with the number of `rn-offset` is retrieved.

-   Parameters
    -   `expr`: a value of any data type.
    -   offset: a constant of the BIGINT type. The value of the offset must be greater than 0. If the input value is of the STRING or DOUBLE type, it is implicitly converted into the BIGINT type before calculation.
    -   default: the default value that is used if offset is out of the valid range. It is a constant value and its default value is NULL.
    -   `partition by [col1, col2..]`: partitioning columns.
    -   `order by col1[asc|desc], col2[asc|desc]`: the field based on which data is ranked.
-   Return value

    Returns a value of the same data type as `expr`.

-   Example

    ```
    select seq, lag(seq+100, 1) over (partition by window order by seq) as r from sliding_window;
    -- The following result is returned:
    +------------+------------+

## CLUSTER\_SAMPLE

-   Syntax

    ```
    boolean cluster_sample([Bigint x, Bigint y])
    over(partition by [col1, col2..])
    ```

-   Description

    Performs group sampling on data in a window.

-   Parameters
    -   x: a constant of the BIGINT type. The value of `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. If y is specified, x indicates that a window is divided into x portions. Otherwise, x indicates that the records of x rows in a window are extracted. In this case, True is returned for the x rows. If x is NULL, NULL is returned.
    -   y: a constant of the BIGINT type. The value of `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 and must be less than or equal to `x`. y indicates that y records of the x portions in a window are extracted. In this case, True is returned for the y records. If y is set to NULL, NULL is returned.
    -   `partition by [col1, col2]`: partitioning columns.
-   Return value

    Returns a value of the BOOLEAN type.

-   Example
