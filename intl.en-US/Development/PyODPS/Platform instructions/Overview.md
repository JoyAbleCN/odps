# Overview

PyODPS can be called as a data development node on a data development platform such as DataWorks. The platform provides a PyODPS running environment and can schedule and run nodes. You do not need to manually create a MaxCompute entry object. To migrate PyODPS nodes from a data development platform to a manually deployed PyODPS environment, read the instructions in the following topics:
