# Connection to the Tunnel or DataHub service

You must use different endpoints to connect to the Tunnel or DataHub service in different network environments.

The endpoints that are used to connect to the Tunnel and DataHub services vary based on the network environment. You must use the endpoint that matches the current network environment. Otherwise, your requests to the service fail. [Costs](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Computing pricing.md) vary based on the endpoint that you use.

For more information about the endpoints, see [Configure endpoints](/intl.en-US/Prepare/Configure endpoints.md).
