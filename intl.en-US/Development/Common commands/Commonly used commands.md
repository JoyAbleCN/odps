# Commonly used commands

This topic describes the commonly used commands that the MaxCompute client supports.

Commonly used commands are updated in the latest version of MaxCompute. After the update, you can use the commands in a similar way to those in Hive, which brings convenience to Hadoop and Hive users.

MaxCompute allows you to perform operations on objects, such as [projects](/intl.en-US/Development/Common commands/Project operations.md), [tables](/intl.en-US/Development/Common commands/Table-level operations.md), [resources](/intl.en-US/Development/Common commands/Resource operations.md), and [instances](/intl.en-US/Development/Common commands/Instance operations.md). You can use client commands or SDK to perform operations on these objects.

**Note:**

-   The commands in this topic apply to the MaxCompute [client](/intl.en-US/Prepare/Install and configure the odpscmd client.md).
-   For more information about how to install and configure the client, see [Install and configure the odpscmd client](/intl.en-US/Prepare/Install and configure the odpscmd client.md).
-   For more information about SDK, see [MaxCompute SDK](/intl.en-US/Development/MapReduce/Java SDK/Java SDK.md).

## Limits

When you perform resource-related operations, the size of each resource file cannot exceed 500 MB. The total size of resources that are referenced by a single SQL statement or MapReduce job cannot exceed 2,048 MB. For more information, see [MapReduce limits](/intl.en-US/Development/MapReduce/Limits.md).
